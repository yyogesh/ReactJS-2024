React Hooks

useState - declares a state variable that you can update directly. - done
useEffect - connects a component to an external system. - done
useRef - declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node. - done
useImperativeHandle - lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used - done
useMemo - lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
useCallback - lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
useContext - reads and subscribes to a context.
useReducer - declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function
useLayoutEffect - fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
useInsertionEffect - fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.
useTransition - lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
useDeferredValue - lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.
useDebugValue - lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.
useId - lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.
useSyncExternalStore - lets a component subscribe to an external store.
useActionState - allows you to manage state of actions.
